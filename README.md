How It Works
HTML
The HTML file sets up the structure of the calculator, including the input field, result display, and buttons for each digit and operation.

CSS

showelement(ele): This function is triggered when a button is clicked. It processes the button's text to perform the appropriate operation.

Clear ('c'): Clears the input and result.
Operator buttons ('+', '-', 'x', 'รท'): Appends the respective operator to the input value.
Sign Inversion ('+/-'): Changes the sign of the current input value.
Percentage ('%'): Calculates the percentage of the current input value.
Equals ('='): Evaluates the expression and displays the result.
Default (Number and Decimal buttons): Appends the clicked button's value to the input field and calculates the result.
